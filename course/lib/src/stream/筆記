Using a StreamController

If the events of your stream comes from different parts of your program,
and not just from a stream or futures that can traversed by an async function, 
then use a StreamController to create and populate the stream.

A StreamController gives you a new stream and a way to add events to the stream 
at any point, and from anywhere. The stream has all the logic necessary to handle 
listeners and pausing. You return the stream and keep the controller to yourself.
